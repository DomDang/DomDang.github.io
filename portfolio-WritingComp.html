            What started as an extra project in my English class in 9th grade, turned into 2 years of writing about my
            previous sports experience.
            The Will McDonough Writing Contest is named in honor of the Boston Globe sportswriter. In
            2020, over 1,100 students from across New England participated in the contest. I decided to write from my
            experience in marching band and I had the opportunity to win <a
              href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/24/sports/2020-will-mcdonough-writing-contest-winners-announced/"
              target="_blank"> first place </a> in the competition during my ninth grade year. During 2021 and the
            pandemic, I participated in the competition again and I wrote about my experience in a ballet dance class. I had the
            opportunity to win <a
              href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/24/sports/2020-will-mcdonough-writing-contest-winners-announced/"
              target="_blank"> first place </a> in the competition during 2021.

            Below is my entry for my 2020 and 2021 competitions.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2> A Game of Sportsmanship: A Marching Band vs. A Football Team </h2>
          <p>
            The stands rumbled as the placekicker took his spot in front of the football. My newly shined marching band
            shoes joined the stampede, matching the roar of the rest of the marching band. The band director
            was in a contortionist position, twisting his head so he could watch the game while his feet faced us to
            conduct whenever needed. The countdown in my head started, anxiously waiting for the ball to go through the
            goalposts. Suddenly he kicked it. The ball went soaring for the extra point and the stands erupted into
            cheers. My band director snapped his head back to us and in a matter of seconds we were playing our high
            school song, loud and proud. The cheerleaders on the field danced to our music, performing jaw-dropping
            stunts and routines. We were smiling, laughing, and cheering our football team on; but we could not
            completely celebrate yet. There was one more thing we had to complete: the halftime show. </p>
            
            <p>Again, the
            countdown in my head started; this time for the second quarter to end and for us to get on the field. I held
            my shako and plume tightly in my left hand and my piccolo in my other hand, shivering slightly from the
            cold. The piccolo players in the section stood beside me and the other instrumentalists lined up behind us.
            The sound of a shrill whistle and the opening of the looming gates tore me from my thoughts and the band
            entered the field. </p>

          <p> A thread of fear came trickling in as I put my shako on my head. The marching band has faced issues with
            the sportsmanship the football players display towards the marching band. The bad sportsmanship we received
            every game discouraged us because many do not know how much effort we put into every performance. Marching
            is not like other sports with innings or quarters or periods. Our performances only last about seven
            minutes; and we have one opportunity to show the audience what we have. There are no substitutions or
            timeouts or fouls. If someone gets hurt during practice or during the performance, the show must go on. We
            work as many hours and commit so much of our time into something we love. However, it is not the crowd that
            drives our performances; it is our love for music and our determination of being one of the top marching
            bands in the state. </p>
            
            <p>With that, I put my piccolo in rest position and prepared to give the best performance I
            could. Dodging the towering plumesand shakos to catch a glimpse of the drum major, I was surprised to see a
            large crowd on the sidelines. There, sitting criss-crossed applesauce and smiling broadly, was our high
            school’s football team. They all gave us thumbs-ups and cheered when the drum major took his position. When
            the performance started, I became completely focused. I could feel the highs and lows of the piece, my feet
            following perfectly with the rhythm. When we finished, I took a deep breath and I could distinctly hear the
            thundering applause of the crowd and the football team. It was definitely different from our usual shows;
            but I felt so much pride for our team as well as the football team for displaying such sportsmanship to
            support each other’s victories. In the end, sportsmanship isn’t a game to be won or lost. It’s a game where
            everyone deserves equal amounts of respect and I think that tonight, both teams displayed exceptionally good
            sportsmanship.</p>

          <h2> Again: A Dancing Inspiration </h2>
          <p> The floor felt like clouds.
          </p>
          <p> <i>I began dancing when I was 5 years old. I was too young to fully realize what I was signing up for but
              old enough to have fallen in love with dancing. I believed that anywhere was my dance floor from the long
              aisles of the grocery story to the cramped space in my room. Everywhere was a perfect place for a plie,
              kick, and pirouette.
              I would spend hours outside the studio watching videos of recitals, performances, and studio practices
              from companies like the Boston Ballet. My eyes were glued to the ballerina leaping through the air. My
              head and shoulders mimicked the dancers, turning abruptly but gently settling back down to first position.
              My legs tried to mirror the men’s effortless broad jumps and soaring leaps with questionable success.
            </i>
          </p>
          <p> I couldn’t rely on muscle memory for the next part though. I reached upward, in preparation to raise my
            leg behind me in an elegant arabesque. Shoulders down, hips square, legs turned out. Thousands of thoughts
            in my mind as I began lifting my leg.
          </p>
          <p>Then a loud yell.
          </p>
          <p>Then the music stopped. Someone’s foot flew in my face. I hope it was a foot, maybe it was an arm. Strong
            arms turned to spaghetti and perfect lines, to messy scribbles. Gangly limbs and sweaty feet grouped in the
            center with our dance teacher, who had a notepad in hand. It was nothing out of the ordinary; simply the
            usual “stop and adjust” of a regular dance practice.
          </p>
          <p><i>As I grew up in the dance studio, I met friends who bonded over worn shoes and types of hairspray and
              learned from remarkable teachers who all shared their passion for dance. Some teachers have specific
              techniques - for years after every pointe class, we would spend ten minutes writing the alphabet using our
              feet to strengthen our ankles. Others have unique styles and love to tell a story with their choreography.
              All of my teachers wanted us to grow as dancers and individuals. To do that, they often gave feedback
              either minor comments or crucial corrections. Either way, we gladly took them as an opportunity to
              improve.
            </i></p>
          <p>“Make sure to point your feet,” she said to my classmate. </p>
          <p>“Sharper arms for a better turn,” she advised another.
          </p>
          <p>She turned to me, “Look graceful, this part is difficult but no one needs to know that.”
          </p>
          <p>I nodded, mentally kicking myself for being distracted with clouds. This choreography was intense. A mix of
            modern, jazz, and ballet, our teacher combined her classical background with our contemporary knowledge.
            After she combed through what seemed like a mile long list of corrections, she folded her notepad and stared
            us all in the eyes.
          </p>
          <p>“Again.” </p>
          <p>We took a deep breath - taking in our mistakes and focusing on our next run. Fixing our stray hairs,
            adjusting our shoes, and placing ourselves in position, we waited for the 5, 6, 7, 8 before the music began.
            But before the count, I looked at our teacher and smiled - a little thank you for being my most influential
            person in sports.
          </p>
